# Family Tree (Template)

This is the Family Tree template made by Mayeenul Islam with the love of dTree.

üëâ [**Demo**: Family Tree in Bengali](https://mayeenulislam.github.io/family-tree-template/)

> **Note:** Actually I made a family tree for my family in a quick round and thought it might help the others. Hence compiled the code for public. This repository in its **rudimentary shape**.<br>If you make improvement, please don't hesitate to submit Pull Request.

## Features

- Family Tree in Tree View
- Family Tree as a list
- Family Tree List has Collapse/Expand feature
- Bengali Support (`bn`)
- Responsive and Mobile-friendly

## Usage

Update the `family-tree.json` file

### Syntax: Marriage & Children

```json
"marriages" : [
  {
    "spouse" : {
      "name" : "‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶ß‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Æ‡ßÄ‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ",
      "class" : "female"
    },
    "children" : [
      {
        "name" : "‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶®",
        "class" : "male"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Syntax: Person

```json
{
  "name" : "‡¶¨‚Äç‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ",
  "extra" : {
    "nickname" : "‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ"
  },
  "class" : "male",
  "textClass" : "emphasis"
}
```

## Limitations

One: When the tree expands with too many leaves, the tree becomes clueless to the audience (limitation of dTree)

Two: Tree View cannot be collapsed (dTree library does not support that feature)
